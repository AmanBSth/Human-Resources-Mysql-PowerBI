1. Data Loading: The dataset was loaded into a Mysql Workbench for analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and dealing with outliers were performed.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data visualizations, and data profiling were conducted to understand the dataset.

4. Feature Engineering: New features were created to aid in the analysis.

5. Data Transformation: Data was transformed for use in the Power BI dashboard.

## Power BI Dashboard

The cleaned and transformed data from the data exploration phase were used to create a dashboard that provides interactive visualizations and insights about the Human Resources data.
